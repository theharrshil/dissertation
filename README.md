# How to run this application

1. Go to the directry in your terminal
2. run `npm install`
3. I use PNPM for my package manager so it might cause some issue but if you PNPM then this should work fine
4. After, installing the dependencies, just run `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev` and the application will start on localhost with port 3000.
